# Impractical Python Projects
This contains all the code that I write while going through the book ***Impractical Python: Projects Playful Programming Activities to Make You Smarter*** by ***Lee Vaughan***.

## Index
1. [Silly Name Generator](./random-name)
2. [Finding Palingram Spells](./palingrams)
3. [Solving Anagrams](./anagrams)

## Running a Script
Scripts should be run from the `impractical-projects` directly using the following command
```
python -m [folder].[file]
```

Example: Let's say you want to run the palindromes script, simply run it by
```
python -m palingrams.palindromes
```
