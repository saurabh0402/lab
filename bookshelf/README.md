# Bookshelf ðŸ“š
A simple UI mock, created using React Native and Expo, of a bookish app that allows users to store the books from their shelves, their thoughts, quotes, rating, and everything else securely.

I will be trying to add the following to the app:
- [ ] A beautiful splash screen
- [ ] A button on the splash screen that takes us to the actual "bookshelf"
- [ ] A list of books that the user has added
- [ ] Tabs to divide the books in folders
- [ ] A new book details screen that we get to on clicking the book
- [ ] The new page should display all the details of the book
- [ ] Tabs in the info page showing details, user thoughts, quotes, etc.
