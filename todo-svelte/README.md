# To Do
This is a tiny, simple to do app in Svelte. It has no backend, and will (hopefully) use local storage to store the data. The plan of action for this is:
- [x] Setup a simple Svelte project with hot reloading.
- [x] Create the simplest to do app with all code in a single file.
- [x] Split the code into multiple files.
- [x] Add some UI library - Svelte Material UI maybe
- [ ] Make it beautiful
- [ ] Move data to local storage
